This mod adds a convenient trash bin slot to your inventory for easy item disposal.

It is **required** on the server, but **optional** on the client, meaning only the players that want to use it should install it.

## Features

### 🗑️ Trash Bin Slot
- Adds a dedicated trash bin slot to your inventory interface
- Items placed in this slot are **permanently deleted**
- Seamlessly integrates with **survival mode**, **creative mode**, and **all container interfaces**

### 🎯 Slot Highlighting
- **Shift + Hover**: When you hold Shift and hover over the bin slot while holding an item, the mod highlights all matching items (based on ID) in your inventory with a red overlay
- This feature helps you quickly identify which items will be deleted

### 🖱️ Intuitive Controls
- **Left Click**: Delete items from your cursor stack
- **Right Click**: Delete a single item from your cursor stack
- **Shift + Hover**: Preview which items will be highlighted for deletion
- **Shift + Hover + Click**: Delete items from your cursor stack and all matching items from your inventory
- **Shift + Click with empty cursor stack**: Deletes every item from your **creative** inventory (`v1.1.0+`)

### 🌐 Translations
- Built-in translations for all the languages in the game

## Customization

### 🖼️ **Bin Slot Texture**
- The trash bin slot texture is automatically generated using built-in game textures and adapts to match your active resource pack's inventory GUI style
- Alternatively, you can customize the slot texture by using a resource pack that supports this mod
